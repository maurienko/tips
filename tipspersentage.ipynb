        "### Q&A\n",
        "*   **Which categorical features influence tip percentages most significantly?**\n",
        "    The `size` of the dining party shows the most significant variation in mean tip percentage, with smaller groups (size 1) tipping considerably higher (21.73%) compared to larger groups. Among days, Friday has the highest mean tip percentage (16.99%).\n",
        "*   **Are there noticeable differences in tipping behavior based on 'sex', 'smoker' status, 'day', or 'time'?**\n",
        "    Yes, there are differences:\n",
        "    *   **Sex**: Female customers tip slightly more on average (16.65%) than male customers (15.77%).\n",
        "    *   **Smoker Status**: Smokers show a slightly higher mean tip percentage (16.32%) compared to non-smokers (15.93%).\n",
        "    *   **Day**: Friday has the highest mean tip percentage (16.99%), while Saturday has the lowest (15.32%).\n",
        "    *   **Time**: Lunch has a slightly higher mean tip percentage (16.41%) than Dinner (15.95%).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The `tip_percentage` was calculated and added as a new column, indicating the tip as a percentage of the total bill.\n",
        "*   **Mean tip percentage by sex**: Female customers had a slightly higher mean tip percentage (16.65%) compared to male customers (15.77%).\n",
        "*   **Mean tip percentage by smoker status**: Smokers had a slightly higher mean tip percentage (16.32%) than non-smokers (15.93%).\n",
        "*   **Mean tip percentage by day**: Friday showed the highest mean tip percentage (16.99%), followed by Sunday (16.69%), Thursday (16.13%), and Saturday (15.32%).\n",
        "*   **Mean tip percentage by time**: Lunch had a slightly higher mean tip percentage (16.41%) compared to Dinner (15.95%).\n",
        "*   **Mean tip percentage by size**: Smaller groups (size 1) exhibited a significantly higher mean tip percentage (21.73%). The tip percentage generally decreased as group size increased, though size 6 showed a slight increase over size 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   **Insight**: Group size appears to be the most influential factor on tip percentage, with single diners tipping disproportionately more. This suggests that smaller parties might feel more obliged to tip a higher percentage or perhaps tend to order less expensive items, leading to a higher percentage when a standard tip amount is given.\n",
        "*   **Next Steps**: Investigate the relationship between `total_bill` and `tip_percentage` across different `size` categories to understand if a smaller `total_bill` for single diners artificially inflates their `tip_percentage`. Additionally, explore if there are interactions between features, e.g., how `day` and `time` might jointly influence tipping behavior.\n"
